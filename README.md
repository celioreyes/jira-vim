# jira-vim
A vim plugin to access your Jira workspace directly from Vim

## Current Stage: Writing a design doc

The half-baked documentation for this project in progress is [here](https://github.com/paulkass/jira-vim/wiki/Design-Plan).

## Dependencies on other Vim Plugins

The default formatting uses [Tabularize](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular). To put it in your plugin manager, add 
```vimscript
Plug 'godlygeek/tabular'
```
